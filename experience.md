### Software Engineering Intern, CTRL Labs
#### May 2019 - August 2019

CTRL Labs was developing an EMG-based, non-invasive neural interface called CTRL Kit with potential applications in AR/VR, Robotics and general Human-Machine Interaction. It has now been acquired by Facebook and is part of Facebook Reality Labs.

My first project was interfacing a hexapod robot with CTRL Kit allowing the robot's legs to mimic finger movements of a human user. You can read about it [in the projects section.](/projects.html#robot-teleoperation-through-neuromuscular-control)

For my main project, I devised some experimental features for CTRL Kit involving physically contextualized interactions with real-world objects and spaces and prototyped them. A patent application was recently filed for these features. I will be able to add more information here when it become public.
