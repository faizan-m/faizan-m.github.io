## Research Assistant, Autonomous Intelligent Robotics Lab, Tufts University 
### (ROS, Unity, C++, C#, Python)
### Jan 2018 - Present

I started working with Professor Jivko Sinapov starting Spring semester of my Sophomore year. During the first few months, I developed some software in ROS for data-logging the Turtlebot robots in our lab. 

For Summer 2018, I proposed an Augmented Reality interface for these Turtlebots that would allow users to visualize the robots' state, intentions and knowledge. This proposal was accepted and funded by Tufts Summer Scholars. The project later grew to include multiple undergraduate students and one graduate student. 

The interface allows a user to visualize a robot's state, intent and plan as an additional visual layer over the real world thereby bridging the gap between the digital information inside the robot and our analogue way of perception. 

My role in this project was designing the overall system architecture and implementing the interface between Unity and ROS for data transfer between the robot and the AR device. The interface supports multiple devices including Android smartphones, iOS devices, and Microsoft Hololens. We conducted a preliminary pilot study recently and are now designing a full-scale study investigating the potential of this interface as a tool for Human-Robot Interaction.

This project has received a lot of attention within the university and beyond:
- I presented a [Late Breaking Report](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8673191) in HRI 2019 conference in South Korea. The paper contains details about our system architecture and implementation.
- It was part of the Tufts [proposal](https://www.eecs.tufts.edu/~jsinapov/VAR5G/) that won the 2019 [Verizon 5G EdTech Challenge](https://www.5gedtechchallenge.com/)
- It has been featured in an official Tufts University [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_9RNRNd9y8) and an [article](https://now.tufts.edu/articles/hands-research-undergraduates)

## Software Engineering Intern, CTRL Labs
### (C++, Python, Go)
### May 2019 - August 2019

CTRL Labs is developing an EMG-based, non-invasive neural interface called CTRL Kit with potential applications in AR/VR, Robotics and general Human-Machine Interaction. My first project was interfacing a hexapod robot with CTRL Kit allowing the robot's legs to mimic finger movements of a human user. I also developed a "soccer-mode" that allows the user to move the robot and individually kick its legs using muscle movements and gestures. I believe such control schemes have the potential to be incredibly intuitive and natural and can help break down the interaction barrier with robots. This work was featured in an NPR video recently:

For the rest of my internship, I focused on prototyping some experimental features for CTRL Kit involving interactions with real-world objects and spaces.

## Co-President, Tufts Robotics Club

I have been a part of the Tufts Robotics Club since freshman year and have been particularly involved with the [development of fire-fighting robots](/projects.html#trinity-college-international-fire-fighting-robot-contest). 

During the sophomore year, I was a Software Specialist in the Executive Board and focused on designing software architecture for our projects and teaching new members about software development for robots. 

In my junior year, I was elected Co-President of the club. My main objective in that role personally was improving club diversity, accessibility and member retention. These issues were approached by formalizing member attendance during meetings to keep track of member activity and club growth. It was discovered that new members felt like they lacked ownership in the seemingly complex projects the club was working on. This gave rise to a sense that they could not contribute much to the club. Tackling this problem involved breaking down key project goals with them and identifying tasks that they could do or learn to do. 

Based on the advice provided by some of the Tufts' researchers working on these issues, club dynamics for members were enhanced to ensure that the space was comfortable and welcoming for all skill levels. By the end of that year, the active members more than doubles as compared to last year and the ensuing Executive Board is the most diverse group the club has ever had.


## Research Assistant, Center for Engineering Education and Outreach, Tufts University
### (OpenCV, C++, LabVIEW, Arduino)
### Dec 2016 - Aug 2017
I worked in Dr. Ethan Danahy's Lab in CEEO during the freshman year of college focusing on some of the ongoing lab and research projects. My first project was designing a RESTful API for IoT devices in the lab. This was followed by implementing this system for an Arduino-powered lab sign that could change colors depending on the requests it received through the internet. 

My second project involved working on the Computer Vision side of [InterLACE](https://ceeo.tufts.edu/research/projectsInterLACE.htm) (Interactive Learning and Collaboration Environment) which is a digital tool that teachers can use to enhance students' classroom experience by promoting collaboration and discussion. I wrote code to automatically and robustly extract different sections of worksheets based on given scanned images. This would act as a convenient classwork digitization tool which allowed teachers to go through the classwork section by section and share any interesting responses with the class. 

Using that tool, I explored the possibility of digitally parsing some of those sections into meaningful data. As a particular examples, a programmable worksheet was devised and implemented that young students could simply draw on to program robots:
