### Software Engineering Intern, CTRL Labs
#### May 2019 - August 2019

* CTRL Labs was developing an EMG-based, non-invasive neural interface called CTRL Kit (now acquired by Facebook)

* Interfaced a hexapod robot with CTRL Kit for [neuromuscular teleoperation](/projects.html#robot-teleoperation-through-neuromuscular-control)

* Devised experimental features for CTRL Kit involving physically contextualized interactions with real-world objects and spaces 

* Prototyped these features and helped file a patent application for them
