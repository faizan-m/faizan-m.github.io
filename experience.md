## Software Engineering Intern, CTRL Labs
### (C++, Python, Go)
### May 2019 - Present

I worked on interfacing a hexapod robot with CTRL Kit allowing the robot's legs to mimic finger movement of a human user. I also developed a "soccer-mode" that allows the user to move the robot and individually control 4 of its legs using purely muscle movements and gestures. This work was also featured in an NPR video below:

I have been a part of the Tufts Robotics Club since freshman year and have been particularly involved with the [development of fire-fighting robots](/projects.html#trinity-college-international-fire-fighting-robot-contest). 

During the sophomore year, I was a Software Specialist in the Executive Board and focused on designing software architectures for our projects and teaching new members about software development for robots. 

In my junior year, I was elected Co-President of the club. My main objective in that role was improving club diversity, accessibility and member retention. I approached these issues by formalizing member attendance during meetings to keep track of member activity and club growth. One of the key insights I learned by talking to some of the new members is that they felt like they lacked any ownership in the seemingly complex projects the club was working on and felt like they could not contribute much to the club. Tackling this problem involved breaking down key goals with them and indentifying tasks that they could do or learn to do. Using this technique with all incoming members also helped increase club productivity.

## Research Assistant, Center for Engineering Education and Outreach, Tufts University
### (OpenCV, C++, LabVIEW, Arduino)
### Dec 2016 - Aug 2017
I worked in Dr E's Lab in CEEO during the freshman year of college focusing on some of the lab and research projects he was interested in. My first project was designing a RESTful API for some of the IoT devices in the lab and implementing it for an Arduino-powered lab sign that could change colors depending on the requests it received through the internet. 

My second project involved working on the Computer Vision side of [InterLACE](https://ceeo.tufts.edu/research/projectsInterLACE.htm) (Interactive Learning and Collaboration Environment) which is a digital tool that teachers can use to enhance students' classroom experience by promoting collaboration and discussion. I wrote code to automatically and robustly extract different sections of worksheets based on given scanned images. This would act as a convenient classwork digitization tool which once paired with the rest of the InterLACE pipeline allowed teachers to go through the classwork section by section and share any interesting responses with the class. I then explored the possibility of digitally parsing some of those sections into meaningful data. In particular, I devised and implemented a programmable worksheet that children could use to easily program robots by just drawing on it:
