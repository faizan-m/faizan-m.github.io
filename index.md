    As an AI enthusiast, my main interest is in Neurosymbolic AI. I am curious about how we can develop AI agents that can solve problems creatively, have a nuanced understanding of their world, and are highly adaptable to change.

    At a personal level, I find myself particularly inspired by semiotics, media art, and cultural anthropology.
