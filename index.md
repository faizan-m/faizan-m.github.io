    I am a Google engineer working at the intersection of LLMs, multi-step reasoning and knowledge representation. Previously, I have contributed to <a href="[https://www.tensorflow.org/](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commits/master/?author=faizan-m)">TensorFlow</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11805">Gemini</a>.

    As an AI enthusiast, my main interest is in Neurosymbolic AI. I am curious about how we can develop AI agents that can solve problems creatively, have a nuanced understanding of their world, and are highly adaptable to change.

    At a personal level, I find myself particularly inspired by semiotics, media art, and Sufi philosophy. I talk about my musings on <a href="https://medium.com/@faizan.muham">Medium</a>.
