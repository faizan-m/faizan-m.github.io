    My main research interest area is Neurosymbolic AI. I am also interested in its intersection with other fields such as Reinforcement Learning and Multi-Agent Interaction (including HRI). I want to develop AI agents that can solve problems creatively, have a nuanced understanding of their world, and are highly adaptable to change.

    As an engineer, I am a big fan of both prototyping and productionizing impactful ideas. I quite enjoy developing data pipelines and training infrastructure for effective deployment of ML models.

    I am also particularly inspired by semiotics, media art, and cultural anthropology.
