    As an engineer, I am equally a fan of prototyping and productionizing impactful ideas. I quite enjoy developing data pipelines and training infrastructure for effective deployment of ML models.

    As an AI enthusiast, my main interest is in Neurosymbolic AI. I am also interested in its intersection with other fields such as Reinforcement Learning and Multi-Agent Interaction (including HRI). I am curious how we can develop AI agents that can solve problems creatively, have a nuanced understanding of their world, and are highly adaptable to change.

    On a personal level, I am particularly inspired by semiotics, media art, and cultural anthropology.
