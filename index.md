    As an engineer, I am a big fan of both prototyping and productionizing impactful ideas. I quite enjoy developing data pipelines and training infrastructure for effective deployment of ML models.

    As an AI enthusiast, my main interest is in Neurosymbolic AI as well as its intersection with other fields such as Reinforcement Learning and Multi-Agent Interaction (including HRI). I am curious about how we can develop AI agents that can solve problems creatively, have a nuanced understanding of their world, and are highly adaptable to change.

    At a personal level, I find myself particularly inspired by semiotics, media art, and cultural anthropology.
