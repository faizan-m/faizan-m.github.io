I dream of a future where machines enhance and augment our shared humanity. While technology has the potential to fundamentally transform our definitions of society and humanity, I believe conscious and ethical design is the key to ensuring that this impact remains wholly positive. My key interest areas include Robotics, Neural Interfaces, Computer Vision and Augmented Reality.

I am curious about what traits we choose to define as being "human", how technology impacts them and how can we use technology to enhance them. I am also interested in these traits as an inspiration for building smarter and more robust robots.
