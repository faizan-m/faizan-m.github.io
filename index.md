				<p>I am an undergraduate student pursuing Computer Science and I dream of a future where machines enhance and augment our shared humanity.</p>
				<p>I am curious about what traits we choose to define as being "human", how technology currently impacts them and how can we use technology to positively enhance them. </p>
				<p>I am also interested in these traits as an inspiration for building smarter and more robust robots.</p>
				<p>My experience and interest areas include Robotics, Neural Interfaces, Computer Vision and Augmented Reality.</p>
